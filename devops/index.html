    <p>Where development, developers and testing meet IT Operations. Automation and workflow of processes to enable your business to move faster, become more agile and respond to your customers wants and needs faster.</p>
    <p>Its a culture of cooperation. Its empowering developers to self serve, or at least have operations as part of the development team.</p>
    <p>Software engineering is creating software. Operations is (usually but not always) deployment of the software and maintenance of a platform ( the dependencies required for the software to run).</p>
    <p>We use Cloud technologies from AWS (Amazon Web Services), puppet (server build automation and Configuration management), Jenkins (workflow management) and git (version control of source code and configuration).</p>
    <h2>AWS</h2>
    <p>Infrastructure components including servers (EC2), storage (EBS and S3), Containers (ECS), and Load Balancers (ELB) require some wrangling to get working and at the best price.
      We can provide solutions for you and your team to use for your website or application that you look after. We will build a solution with documentation where we can work for you or with you.</p>
    <h2>Puppet</h2>
    <p>Part of the toolset we use is Puppet. If you rather we can provide solutions in Ansible. These products enable a repeatable way to configure your servers and environments.
    Where you have multiple environments, this enables development to be the same as production, so you know that software tested in development will work exactly the same in production.</p>
    <h2>Jenkins</h2>
    <p>Workflow/CI tools like Jenkins or concourse, enable repeatable and automated processes to free up your team to add value, rather than manually building and testing. </p>
    <h2>git</h2>
    <p>Version control along with Pull Requests enable controlled releases of the software development process. We can offer guidance and processes to help your teams with Version Control.</p>
