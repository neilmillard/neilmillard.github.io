<h3>Puppet</h3><br />
<p>After becoming very inspired following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr8H0wSUMBY">Martin Alfke's "Moving From Exec to Types and Providers" talk</a> at <a href="https://blog.mitese.co.uk/2016/11/09/puppet-camp-fall-autumn-london-2016/">Puppet camp London</a>, I feel the need to share the love that is <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/guides/custom_types.html">Types and Providers</a>.</p>
<h4>What are types and providers?</h4><br />
<p>These are the building blocks of Puppet, written in Ruby that give us the <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/types/">Resource&nbsp;types</a> in our classes, such as <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/types/file.html">File</a> or <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/types/user.html">User</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't mind 'fun' language, then <a href="https://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/11/25/fun-with-providers/">Gary's post Fun with Providers</a>&nbsp;here will help explain things better than I can here.</p>
<h4>Why now?</h4><br />
<p>I'm currently working on a scalable and resilient Mongodb replication cluster and have this long bash script triggered by an <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/types/exec.html">Exec</a>. This is bad, not only because exec statements are a sign that <a href="https://blog.mitese.co.uk/2016/01/05/cost-of-technical-debt/">technical debt</a> is building, but the audit entries from Puppet are sparse.</p>
<p>My team will be working on getting up to speed with types and providers to create a much better Mongodb puppet module experience.</p>
<p>All going well, this code may find its way into the <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mongodb">puppetlabs mongodb</a> module.</p>
