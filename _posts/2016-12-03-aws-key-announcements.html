<p>Amazon Web Services have and do this. That is why they offer well over 1000 services. Removing pain points and giving the choice of how you want to build the products and services you want to build. From primitives with Compute, Memory and Disk, to advanced services for you to choice made up from these primitives RDS, ECS and Lambda. This gives you the choice so you don't have to worry about managing the detail.</p>
<p>Software changes rapidly with agility gives the systems to rapidly deploy code in a reliable way. Scaling and deploying with 99.999% uptime is a reality. By using the components and removing points of failure and planned rapid deployments every day, will allow your business and software platform to grow daily and even hourly.</p>
<h3>Development, Data and Compute</h3>
<h5>Develop, test and operations</h5><br />
<p>Reduce risk; Smaller, targeted application; deliver faster; Reactive to customer needs; More experimental.</p>
<p><strong>Development and testing is where agility is</strong>: Unconstrained access to resources; testing with higher fidelity; Faster to market; Major productivity improvement; Significant cost improvements</p>
<p><strong>Well-Architected Framework</strong></p>
<p>Security; Reliability;Performance efficiency;Cost optimisation;Operational excellence (Prepare->Operated->Respond)</p>
<p>Security and Reliability will be improved by Automation</p>
<h5>Prepare</h5><br />
<p>CloudFormation or Infrastructure as Code. Defining your infrastructure environments in code provides consistent secure and reliable systems to develop and run production systems on.<br />
OpsWorks is a managed Chef service.<br />
EC2 Systems Manager. Collection of tools to install and patch packages.</p>
<h5>Operate</h5><br />
<p>AWS CodeBuild - per minute billing for CI/CD build environments. Provide Docker images as a basis for your build machine.</p>
<h5>Respond</h5><br />
<p>Personal Health Dashboard - A personalised view of performance and availability of the AWS services you are using.</p>
