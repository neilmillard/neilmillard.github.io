For the aspiring career go-getter, the obvious path to getting a higher paid job is management.

Higher salary
==========
In my career I followed the path of,
1. Trainee
2. Technician
3. Field Engineer
4. Server Engineer
5. Infrastructure Engineer
6. Senior Infrastructure Engineer
7. Support Team Leader

Each step I earned myself a pay rise. However, that last step, team leader, not very good at it, to be honest.

Sure I liked the salary increase, but the role came with a lot of changes to how I work, how I relate to my team mates,
how I relate to other mangers, and even the level of hands on.

My then boss, and I, both agreed I should step down from the role. But this would cost me the salary increase.

What to do?
==========
I had seen others in my field getting technical jobs within an IT consultancy. I had also heard of IT contractors.
There was of course the side hustle route as well.

So, What did I do? I found a contact in recruitment to help me get a contract. Not a short contract either. A 6 month
contract. Does that sound short? I guess it is in a way, but my "perm" job had 1 month notice, just like the contract
did.

Contracting
======

This gave me the work/life balance, income and satisfaction I was looking for. Sure there was a lot to learn,
1. IR35
2. Self Assessment
3. How to run a limited company
4. Taxes

I had several people to turn to, as well as some mistakes I made along the way.

Your turn
