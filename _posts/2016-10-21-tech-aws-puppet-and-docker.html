<p>In my talk - Can Puppet help you run Docker on a T2.Micro? - You will learn the technologies we use to create environments from scratch every day.</p>
<p>A walk through a number of the key concepts of puppet; stages, Role and profile, hieradata and puppet forge, as well as a brief introduction to Docker.<br />
Using these to explain a solution of running a puppet manifest to configure <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon</a>'s smallest (Yes I've run this on a t2.nano too) server to run a docker containerised web service.<br />
You will learn why puppet stages can be used to help in this solution, how roles and profiles are defined and used, and finally use of the <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/">puppet Forge</a> with Hieradata to install and run docker containers.<br />
This talk will contain links to code that can be used afterwards and I'll touch on what docker is and how to configure the puppet module to automatically run containers.</p>
<p>Come see me talk at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/puppet-camp-london-autumn-2016-tickets-22714020246">Puppet Camp</a> - 8th November 11:15 in London.</p>
