Compliance
====================

As a UK contractor, you have a legal and moral obligation to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. This
includes keeping accurate records, filing timely reports, and paying your taxes on time. Failure to comply with these
obligations can result in serious penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and the loss of your license to operate a business.

In addition to the legal and moral obligations, there are also a number of practical reasons why you should take
compliance seriously. For example, if you are caught non-compliant, you may lose out on future contracts. You may also
find it difficult to get funding from banks or other lenders. You may have to sacrifice the independence and return to
reporting to a line manager in a JOB.

Sounds complicated!
===================

There are a number of steps you can take to ensure compliance.

First, you need to be aware of all the applicable laws and regulations. These are scattered about on Government websites.

Second, you need to keep accurate records. This will help you to track your income and expenses, and to file your taxes on time.

Third, it is your responsibility to file timely reports. This includes filing your tax returns, and submitting any
required reports to the government.

Fourth, you need to pay your taxes on time. This includes both income tax and VAT.

Finally, you need to keep up-to-date with changes in the law.

What can you do?
================

We cover all these in [the course][devopscontractor] in two live sessions. We also provide support and materials to ensure your task is
easy to do, with reminders, worksheets and professional assistance.

By taking these steps, you can ensure that you are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. This will help you to avoid penalties, and to protect your business.
