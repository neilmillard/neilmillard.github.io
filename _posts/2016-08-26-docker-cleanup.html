<p>Quick post about docker.<br />
What is docker?<br />
Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries &ndash; anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment. (<a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.docker.com&#47;what-docker">https:&#47;&#47;www.docker.com&#47;what-docker<&#47;a>)</p>
<p>Docker is gaining popularity and some clients are using it in production. As a method to package and deploy self-sufficient applications in primarily stateless Linux containers it allows a consistent platform that in itself is quite simple for Ops to look after, and we don't need to know the inner workings of the application we are deploying.</p>
<p>However when writing and building Docker images, my virtual machine (local Docker host) starts looking a bit littered with docker containers and images. So here are a few commands to tidy up.</p>
<p>Kill running containers:</p>
<pre><code>docker kill $(docker ps -qa)<br />
<&#47;code><&#47;pre><br />
Delete all containers (and their associated volumes):</p>
<pre><code>docker rm -v $(docker ps -qa)<br />
<&#47;code><&#47;pre><br />
Remove all images:</p>
<pre><code>docker rmi $(docker images -q)<&#47;code><&#47;pre><br />
