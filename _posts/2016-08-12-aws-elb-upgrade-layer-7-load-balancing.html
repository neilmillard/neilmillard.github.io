<p>AWS have announced Application (level 7 on the osi model) Load Balancing.<br />
I've been using HA Proxy to achieve this for a while now.<br />

What does this mean to us?<br />
You can now load balance and direct traffic to a 'target group' of servers. This means you can use on ELB for a website whilst using multiple server groups for each microservice. For instance anything with /api in the url can get directed at a different group to those with /backend in the url. In current setups we are using subdomains to do this, api.webdomain.com and backend.webdomain.com.</p>
<p>Having Application Load Balancers will allow us to simplify and reduce the number of ELBs needed, thus saving money.</p>
<p>This and more features can be found on amazon's blog. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/</a></p>
