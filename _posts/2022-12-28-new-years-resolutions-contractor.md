As the new year approaches, many people are thinking about resolutions they can make to improve their lives in the coming year.

If you're in the market for a new job or looking to change up your career, considering contracting as a resolution for
the new year could be a great way to take control of your professional life and achieve your goals.

Contractor jobs, also known as freelancers or independent contractors, offer a level of flexibility and control that
traditional employment may not. As a contractor, you have the ability to choose which projects you want to work on, set
your own schedule, and potentially even work from home. This can be especially appealing for those who value their
independence and the freedom to manage their own time.

One of the major benefits of contracting is the ability to choose your own projects and clients. This allows you to
specialize in a particular area or industry and build a reputation as an expert in that field. It also allows you to
take on projects that align with your values and interests, rather than being limited to the opportunities that are
available within a single company.

Another advantage of contracting is the potential for higher pay. Since contractors are not typically entitled to the
same benefits as full-time employees, they are often able to negotiate higher rates for their work. This can be
especially appealing for those with specialized skills or a strong track record of success in their field.

Of course, contracting is not without its challenges. As a contractor, you are responsible for managing your own
finances, including paying your own taxes and providing your own benefits. This can be intimidating for those who are
used to having these things taken care of by an employer. It's important to do your research and seek out resources,
such as financial advisors or online tax tools, to help you navigate these responsibilities.

In addition, finding and securing new contracts can be a time-consuming and competitive process. It's important to have
a strong professional network, a compelling portfolio, and a clear understanding of your value proposition in order to
stand out in the market.

Despite these challenges, contracting can be a rewarding and fulfilling career path for those who are willing to put in
the work. If you're considering contracting as a resolution for the new year, here are a few things you can do to get
started:

* Research the market and industry you're interested in contracting in to get a sense of the types of projects and
clients that are available.
* Build your professional network by joining relevant industry groups and attending events.
* Develop a portfolio of your work to showcase your skills and experience.
* Consider working with a contracting agency to help you find and secure contracts.
* Make sure you understand your financial responsibilities as a contractor and seek out resources to help you manage
them.

Overall, contracting can be a great option for those who want more control and flexibility in their career.
