<p>Our Christmas present has arrived! Amazon Web Services have announced general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/12/announcing-the-aws-europe-london-region/">EU London</a>&nbsp;Region.</p>
<p>This has most of the AWS services available but at a slightly higher price than Ireland but cheaper than Frankfurt.</p>
<p>There are other differences, like there are only 2 availability Zones for London currently in use. I expect that to increase to 3 soon along with the demand and growth.</p>
<p>A few services are not available in London region compared to Ireland, so you may need to wait before deploying apps that require one of these:- EFS (Elastic File System), Lambda, &nbsp;ElasticSearch or SES (Simple Email Service).</p>
<p>ECS (Elastic Container Service) is available, so we can continue to grow our Docker workloads.</p>
