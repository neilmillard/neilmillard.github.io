<p>We all know our identity is important. However sometimes, when your label (name) is the same or similar to someone else it can cause problems. I see and hear this problem daily as a project I recently worked on had three Neils in the team. Of course we have surnames too. That is the differentiating factor.<br />
Imagine the shock to the world when lawyers get involved in protecting a name. All sorts of fun can ensue and my opinion is that unless it could easily be confused then there is no issue.<br />
I refer to the NPM shock that devastated a number of websites and applications this week.</p>
<p>Read all about the JavaScript NPM module here.&nbsp;https:&#47;&#47;medium.com&#47;@azerbike&#47;i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c</p>
