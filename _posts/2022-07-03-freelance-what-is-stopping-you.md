title="Indecision about Contracting" %}

**You want to be a freelancing contractor?**

Almost two-fifths of employees (39%) reported that they have considered working for themselves.

When breaking down the reasons why employees are interested in becoming a freelancer,
the research found that the main factor was flexibility (49%).

This was followed by being their boss (48%) and an improved work-life balance (48%).

In addition, the research found that over three in 10 employees (33%) believe that they could make more money working
for themselves.


**Perceived barriers to self-employment**

For those uninterested in becoming a freelancer, the research found that their main reason for not making the switch,
is wanting a fixed regular income (55%), followed by job security (49%).

Further barriers for employees included not knowing where to start (36%), not having enough financial capital to
set up a business (35%) and lacking confidence in their ability to work for themselves (29%).
