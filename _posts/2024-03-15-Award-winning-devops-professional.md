What?
==========
The DevOps excellence awards is an annual ceremony to celebrate DevOps Excellence in the UK. I was proud to be nominated
in the DevOps Professional of the Year 2024 category.
I was on a winners table it appears, as my fellow guests [Cloudbees][cloudbees] and [Riversafe][riversafe] also won awards.

Why?
========
And the winner of the DevOps Professional of the Year Award, for its technical expertise in leveraging
infrastructure, CI/CD methodologies, and Python APIs that clearly demonstrates a capacity for creating
efficient workflows and a significant role in the software delivery process, isâ€¦ Neil Millard, HMRC.

As a CI/CD specialist, I provide senior experience and expertise to run the build jenkins and deployer
systems for the UK Tax platform. This solution uses Python APIs to stitch together components such as
Github, Pager Duty and AWS to provide a seamless experience for the development teams.

Consulting
===========
As your DevOps consultant, I bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the table. Whether you're starting
a new project or looking to optimise your existing infrastructure, I offer personalized consultation tailored
to your specific needs and objectives.

From designing robust CI/CD pipelines to implementing scalable infrastructure solutions, I'll work closely
with you to identify opportunities for improvement and drive results. With a keen eye for industry best
practices and emerging technologies, I'll help you stay ahead of the curve and ensure that your project is
set up for success.
