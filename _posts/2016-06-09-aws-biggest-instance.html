<p>Wow, today I noticed that AWS now provides a truly massive instance. By request at the moment.</p>

<p>Above is the EU-WEST-1 (Ireland) pricing for an on demand instance. That equates to $384 per day.</p>
<p>I'm not sure we've seen a workload that could justify this monster. When configuring a cluster we would usually use smaller and many instances to match the load more closely.<br />
In a monolithic environment this could be used as a single SAP HANA node or similar?</p>
<p>Of course we will update you when we find one in production.</p>
