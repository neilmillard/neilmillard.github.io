<p>Wow, today I noticed that AWS now provides a truly massive instance. By request at the moment.</p>
<table class="tan-table">

<th class="rate">vCPU<&#47;th></p>
<th class="rate">ECU<&#47;th></p>
<th class="rate">Memory (GiB)<&#47;th></p>

<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;thead></p>
<tbody class="body">

<td class="size">x1.32xlarge<&#47;td></p>
<td class="vCPU">128<&#47;td></p>
<td class="ECU">349<&#47;td></p>
<td class="memory">1952<&#47;td></p>
<td class="storage">2 x 1920 SSD<&#47;td></p>
<td class="rate linux">$16.006 per Hour<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;tbody><br />
<&#47;table><br />
Above is the EU-WEST-1 (Ireland) pricing for an on demand instance. That equates to $384 per day.</p>
<p>I'm not sure we've seen a workload that could justify this monster. When configuring a cluster we would usually use smaller and many instances to match the load more closely.<br />
In a monolithic environment this could be used as a single SAP HANA node or similar?</p>
<p>Of course we will update you when we find one in production.</p>
