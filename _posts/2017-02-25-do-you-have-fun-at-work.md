What sort of question is that? I don't know about you, but I feel privileged and happy that I enjoy what I do at work, and would even go as far to call it fun.
I want to be remembered for making work fun for everyone.

Much of what I do on a day to day basis, is automating boring and repetitive work, allowing my colleagues to do fun work instead.
We hear in the press that Artificial Intelligence is going to remove the need for humans to do many jobs. In fact, part of my journey shows that my job has changed due to automation already.

I used to work building servers, configuring servers, when often the client would expect to wait for 2-4 weeks for server to be ready.
Buy it from the hardware manufacturer, wait for shipment, plug all the bits together (often the CPUs would be in separate boxes), power on, install Windows Server, install software.

Now in the virtual and cloud world, I write code, so that at a click of a button, all that boring stuff is done, in about 5 to 20 mins, with a server ready to go to work on Amazons Cloud.

So do you have fun at work too? Who do you know who is fun to work with?
What at work is repetitive that you think computers could help with?

Let me know in the comments.
