<p>This week <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/12/announcing-the-aws-canada-central-region/">AWS have announced availability for a new Canada region</a>. This is the 15th region now in service and builds further anticipation for the new London region due online in the next few months.</p>
<p>Amazon web services continue to grow in capacity, not only in the individual Availability Zones, but also across the world so your servers can be as near to your users and reduce latency (network delays) to a minimum.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Canada the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">basic building block services</a> of EC2 (Elastic compute cloud), S3 (simple storage service) and RDS (Relational Database Service) are already online as well as the other services we expect as standard like SQS and SNS.</p>
