<p>I've been coding a puppet module to install/update the aws EC2 tools on centos.</p>
<p>These are already installed on Amazon Linux servers, and as it happens, on the core AMI used by the business.</p>
<p>The trouble I had was determining the version of the tools that was installed if any. This led to some frustration as the newer features such as<br />
<em>ec2-copy-snapshot --encrypted</em><br />
are not present in the previous versions of the tools.</p>
<p>well I was very pleased with myself when i found a command to run that told me the version.</p>
<pre>ec2-cmd ShowVersion</pre><br />
Certainly not following the standard of --version or similar, but there is it.</p>
<p>The version (as of Feb 2016) is 1.7.5.1 and latest is available here.</p>
