<h3>Why do you need an architect or designer on your software project?</h3><br />
Writing reusable code is the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>. However it is important to reuse the correct code.</p>
<p>A picture, as they say</p>

<p>Technical Debt and Dependency hell can quickly create big issues and slow a project to a crawl. This can be avoided if a great architect and design steps are involved before the project starts. Often&nbsp;refactoring code will be required to make modules or functions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely coupled</a> and less dependent on each other.</p>
<p>Even within a Scrum and Agile framework, it is better to have a clear view of the end result and understand how the new 'thing', will interface with the existing 'stuff'.</p>
