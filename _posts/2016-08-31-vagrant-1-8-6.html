<p>Like most of my team, I use vagrant to run local boxes for development of puppet builds, ruby apis and such like.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Windows workstation to vagrant 1.8.5 and immediately ran into an issue.</p>
<pre><code>default: Inserting generated public key within guest...<br />
default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...<br />
default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...<br />
default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...<br />
default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...</code></pre><br />
<p>This monkey of an issue had me stumped for a while, as on another project, I was working with securing ssh logins to hosts on AWS, which made me suspect my id_rsa key setup under the git BASH.</p>
<p>My sanity has been saved by the admission of a bug on the vagrant issues list&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7610">https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7610</a></p>
<p>A swift edit of the&nbsp;C:\HashiCorp\vagrant\embedded\gems\gems\vagrant-1.8.5\plugins\guests\linux\cap\public_key.rb file (line 58) and all is good again.</p>

<p>The easier fix is to head over to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">downloads</a> where it is hoped that 1.8.6 will be released on 1st September 2016.</p>
