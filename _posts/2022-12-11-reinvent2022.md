Last weekend was the time for the AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, announcements and more.

There was a lot going on as usual in Las Vegas. I dipped into some of the virtual rooms to watch a few of these, my
timezone making it tricky.

As these are new we will have to wait a while before the [AWS Terraform Provider][terraform] catches up.

Application Integrations just got easier with point and click for [Eventbridge Pipes][pipes]. Event producers and event processors
can now be linked easily through the console. These enable filtered events to be sent directly to a processor.

Lambda got an update too. [Snapstart][snapstart] is automatically enabled for super fast starts of Java 11 Corretto
apps by caching the Init state.

ECS has a new feature, [ECS Service Connect][ecsc] enabling your application in ECS to connect to other ECS services by
name, via AWS Cloud Map. Previously this was only possible via AWS App Mesh.

In RDS land, very excited to see [Blue/Green RDS][bgrds] for fully managed and staged upgrades and migrations for RDS.

Most excited of all is [AWS Lattice][lattice] enabling a consistent way of connecting apps together across AWS. This
enables the creation of a Service Network, controlling network and IAM based access.

For more see [new services announced][reinvent-announcements].

Come ask me and the community questions. You can find me on [Slack]({{site.data.slack.invite}}).
