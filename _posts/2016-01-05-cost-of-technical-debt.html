<p>Technical debt is created when the 'proper way' to do things is not followed, or to put it another way, get it working and we'll fix it up later.</p>
<p>Does that 'later' ever come along. I know in the race to deliver value, these small items can be overlooked, especially if the question is 'fix debt' or 'ship new feature'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these small debts can add up until the status quo is tipped in the balance of technical debt dragging your team down.</p>
<p>This can look like</p>
<ol>
<li>more support calls coming into the helpdesk</li>
<li>more support impacting the call out rota</li>
<li>longer delivery times when adding new features due to work arounds for that bug that will be fixed in the next version</li>
<li>bad publicity due to slow bug fixing</li>
<li>staff turnover due to quality team members losing faith in the team.</li>
</ol><br />
<p>The first step in managing this technical debt, is to make it visible. Add it to the issues list and backlog, and help the product owner understand what a pain it creating during the development process.</p>
<p>Once it is visible, it can then be prioritised or perhaps the decision can be made to live with it. At least it is a conscious choice.</p>
