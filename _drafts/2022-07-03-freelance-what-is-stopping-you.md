Almost two-fifths of employees (39%) reported that they have considered working for themselves.

When breaking down the reasons why employees are interested in becoming a freelancer, the research found that the main factor was flexibility (49%), followed by being their boss (48%) and an improved work-life balance (48%). In addition, the research found that over three in 10 employees (33%) believe that they could make more money working for themselves.


Perceived barriers to self-employment

For those uninterested in becoming a freelancer, the research found that their main reason for not making the switch is wanting a fixed regular income (55%), followed by job security (49%). Further barriers for employees included not knowing where to start (36%), not having enough financial capital to set up a business (35%) and lacking confidence in their ability to work for themselves (29%).
