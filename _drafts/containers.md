|                   | **AWS EKS**                                   | **AWS ECS**                                    | **Docker Swarm**                                  | **Virtual Machines**                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Scale**         | High scalability with automated scaling of Kubernetes clusters. Suitable for large-scale deployments. | High scalability within the AWS ecosystem. Suitable for large-scale containerized applications. | Medium to high scalability. Can handle large clusters but may require more manual configuration. | Scalable based on VM size and number, but requires more manual management. |
| **Cost**          | Higher cost due to Kubernetes management fees in addition to underlying EC2 costs. | Generally lower cost as compared to EKS. Costs depend on the underlying EC2 instances and usage of Fargate. | Lower to moderate cost, primarily depends on the underlying infrastructure and Swarm's lightweight nature. | Varies widely based on VM size, quantity, and licensing fees (e.g., Windows vs. Linux VMs). |
| **Complexity**    | High complexity due to Kubernetes' powerful yet intricate ecosystem. Requires expertise and management of master/worker nodes. | Moderate complexity. Easier to manage than EKS due to AWS integration and ECS's native AWS orchestration capabilities. | Lower complexity. Docker Swarm is simpler to set up and use than Kubernetes but may lack some advanced features. | Varies from moderate to high depending on the operating system, management tools, and scale. Needs more manual setup and maintenance. |
|**Performance**    | High performance with fine-grained control over workloads. Suitable for complex applications requiring high availability and resilience. | High performance within AWS, optimized for container workloads. Good for applications running on AWS infrastructure. | Solid performance for many use cases, though may lack some optimization and advanced features of Kubernetes. | Performance is highly dependent on the underlying hardware and virtualization layer. Can be very performant for single, larger workloads but may not scale as efficiently for microservice architectures. |
