An interesting title and maybe there’s a certain curiosity around its relevance to IT and – in particular – DevOps?

In a word – certainty! To continue the certainty theme – by coining a well-known phrase – the only certainty in life, is change. So why is it that we – as human beings – generally prefer to stick with the tried-and-tested, rather than take a new path and try different things?

Fear of the unknown! I remember a few years ago when I was asked to elaborate on things that caused me pain and made me fearful; my
alpha male-driven ego answering a very defensive – and incorrect – ‘I’m afraid of nothing!’ The reality however, is that pain – if not allowed to compound – can be good; it’s excellent leverage for us to want to embark upon a more prosperous path.

We grow by finding the courage to take calculated risks and embrace the learning from the voyage of discovery; rather than rigidly becoming attached to the outcome – which often disappoints. After all, events in life are neutral; the only power they have, is the power we give them through our own individual perceptions. By encompassing this awareness, we can begin to take the first steps towards the path of prosperity. Question is – are you willing to embark on a journey of learning and take a different direction in life?
