    <p><img style="width:300px;height:300px" align="right" src="{{ site.url }}/public/img/neil_millard_speaking.jpg" alt="Neil Millard" />
    Neil's mission is to make life and work, FUN. Playing the game of life should be a challenge like any game, but it is when it becomes mired by the boring and monotonous, things need to change.</p>
    <p>Business too, is a team sport. This is where the wonderful diversity of life and preferences comes into it's own. You don't like the same stuff as everyone else, which means tasks can be shared with those whom like performing those tasks.</p>
    <p>Neil Millard is a successful entrepreneur, speaker and trainer.
      A recognised expert on cloud and automated server infrastructures, he assists businesses to embrace new technology
      to move faster, become more automated and respond more quickly to their customersâ€™ wants and needs. Having spent
      many years in the financial sector with clients such as Barclays, Lloyds and AXA, he is now on a mission
      to share his knowledge with the world.</p>
